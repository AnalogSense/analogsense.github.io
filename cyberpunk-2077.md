# Leverage analog keyboard input in Cyberpunk 2077

## Using AnalogSense.asi

### Prerequisites

- The Wooting Anlog SDK has to be installed. You can find the latest installers [here](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk/releases).
- If your analog keyboard is not from Wooting, you will also need the [universal-analog-plugin](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin).

### Setup

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/AnalogSense/AnalogSense.asi/releases/latest/download/x64.zip)
2. Locate Cyberpunk 2077's **bin/x64** folder. This folder contains the **Cyberpunk2077.exe**.
3. Drop the dinput8.dll & AnalogSense.asi into this folder.

If you're using Cyber Engine Tweaks, you may have a "plugins" folder where you can place the ASI file, in which case you are free to discard the bundled dinput8.dll.
