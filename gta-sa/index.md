# Analog keyboard input in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA SA)

Back in 2018, Silent made a proof-of-concept version of GInput for Wooting's CODE IT contest. You can [read more about it in his blog.](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/2018/10/24/ginput-wooting-code-it/)

This version is still usable today; all you need is:
- [A download link for it](GInput-Wooting.zip)
- [A replacement for the old analog SDK](https://github.com/AnalogSense/old-wooting-analog-sdk-shim)

Simply follow the GInput installation guide and be sure to replace the `wooting-analog-sdk.dll` as your keyboard will otherwise likely not be supported.
